# MNIST Digit Recognition Model with Regular Neural Network

## Overview

This repository contains a digit recognition model trained on the famous MNIST dataset. The model is implemented using a regular Neural Network (NN) to classify handwritten digits (0 to 9) based on their pixel values.

## Model Architecture

- **Algorithm**: Regular Neural Network (NN)
- **Dataset**: MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset
- **Input**: 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits
- **Output**: Predicted digit (0 to 9)

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- matplotlib
- numpy
